Read the project description file to understand what the program is and what it does.

Run the program from the main file. Follow the instructions on the GUI.
Type known values in each corresponding entry box and "find" in the corresponding
box of the unknown you want found.
Below are the inputs neccesary for each output.

Finding initial velocity needs:
	x initial
	x final
	time
	angle of launch
	force due to wind (x direction only)
	mass of object (Cannot be 0)

or
	y initial
	y final
	time
	angle of launch

Finding final velocity needs:
	initial velocity
	force due to wind (x direction only)
	mass of object (Cannot be 0)
	x initial
	x final
	y initial
	y final
	angle of launch

Finding angle of launch needs:
	initial velocity
	x initial
	x final
	time
	force due to wind (x direction only)
	mass of object (Cannot be 0)

or
	initial velocity
	y initial
	y final
	time

Finding inital x needs:
	initial velocity
	angle of launch
	x final
	time
	force due to wind (x direction only)
	mass of object (Cannot be 0)

Finding final x needs:
	initial velocity
	angle of launch
	x initial
	time
	force due to wind (x direction only)
	mass of object (Cannot be 0)

Finding inital y needs:
	initial velocity
	angle of launch
	y final
	time

Finding final y needs:
	initial velocity
	angle of launch
	y initial
	time

Finding time needs:
	initial velocity
	angle of launch
	x initial
	x final
	force due to wind (x direction only)
	mass of object (Cannot be 0)

or
	initial velocity
	angle of launch
	y initial
	y final

Finding force due to wind (x direction only) needs:
	initial velocity
	angle of launch
	x initial
	x final
	time
	mass of object (Cannot be 0)

Finding mass of object needs:
	initial velocity
	angle of launch
	x initial
	x final
	time
	force due to wind (x direction only)

NOTE: All other combintaions than those otherwise stated above will not work
Also can find an unknown variable to compute the desired output
